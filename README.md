## Divoom (Wifi devices) Integration for Home Assistant

### Credits
This project is based on the hass-divoom integration for Divoom Bluetooth devices by the owners of these git repo (and referenced repos in there):

https://github.com/d03n3rfr1tz3/hass-divoom
https://github.com/enoy19/hass-divoom

I have adopted the approach of enoy19 but rewritten code where things are handled differently in a Wifi setting. The library I'm using for the communication with the Wifi device is coming from this git repo:

### Documentation
I will try to write documentation, but this is only a side project for me where I cannot invest too much time.
