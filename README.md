## Divoom Integration for Home Assistant

### Credits
First of, the whole communication with the Divoom device (focused on my Pixoo for now) is based on gathering information from multiple sources,
that already reverse engineered an older or different Divoom device. Therefore credit goes to the following owners and git repos (you are the heroes here):

https://github.com/RomRider/node-divoom-timebox-evo/ (especially for the [protocol documentation](https://github.com/RomRider/node-divoom-timebox-evo/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md))  
https://github.com/mumpitzstuff/fhem-Divoom  
https://github.com/ScR4tCh/timebox/  
https://bitbucket.org/pjhardy/homeassistant-timebox/src/master/

### Documentation
Further documentation and possibly a HACS integration may follow. For now I'm happy that it works! :D
